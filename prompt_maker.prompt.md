Using matplotlib, create a vertically stacked pair of line graphs positioned adjacent to the hold time table in the AdvancedAccountInfo view:

1. First graph: Plot capital gains over time
   - X-axis: Time period matching the hold time table
   - Y-axis: Capital gains value ($)
   - Maintain the same color scheme as the first graph
   - Add a descriptive title "Capital Gains Progress"

2. Second graph: Plot cumulative dividend gains over time
   - X-axis: Time period matching the hold time table
   - Y-axis: Total accumulated dividends ($)
   - Use the established color scheme for consistency
   - Add a descriptive title "Cumulative Dividend Growth"

Layout specifications:
- Position both graphs to the right of the hold time table
- Stack the graphs vertically with standard spacing
- Ensure consistent figure size and aspect ratio
- Add a legen
- Include proper date formatting on x-axis labels
